FROM users;

**2. How many cookies does each user have on average?**

````sql
SELECT 
    ROUND(COUNT(DISTINCT cookie_id) / COUNT(DISTINCT user_id), 0) Avg_cookies_per_user
FROM users;
````

**3. What is the unique number of visits by all users per month?**
- Extract the month number from `event_time` column to aggregate the data by month and use `COUNT DISTINCT` to get fufil the unique number of visits requirement.


````sql
SELECT 
     MONTH(event_time) month
    ,COUNT(DISTINCT visit_id) unique_user_visits
FROM events
GROUP BY 1;
````

**4. What is the number of events for each event type?**

````sql
SELECT 
     event_type
    ,COUNT(*) number_of_events
FROM events
GROUP BY 1;
````

<img width="276" alt="image" src="https://github.com/Gbemiclassic/Clique-Bait/blob/main/Images/Digital%20Analysis/p4.jpg">

**5. What is the percentage of visits which have a purchase event?**
- Join the events and events_identifier table
- Use a `COUNT` with a `CASE` statement to include only visit_ids with a purchase event as the numerator
- Then, divide the number of purchase events with the total number of distinct visits from the `events` table.

````sql
SELECT 
    CONCAT(ROUND(100 * COUNT(DISTINCT CASE WHEN ei.event_name = 'Purchase' THEN visit_id ELSE NULL END) 
        / COUNT(DISTINCT visit_id), 2), '%') pct_purchase
FROM events e
	LEFT JOIN event_identifier ei
		ON e.event_type = ei.event_type;
````

**6. What is the percentage of visits which view the checkout page but do not have a purchase event?**


````sql
WITH cte AS(
SELECT
     COUNT(CASE WHEN event_type = 1 AND page_id = 12 THEN visit_id ELSE NULL END) checkouts
    ,COUNT(CASE WHEN event_type = 3 THEN visit_id ELSE NULL END) purchases
FROM events
)
 SELECT 
    CONCAT(ROUND(100 * (checkouts - purchases)/ checkouts, 2), '%') pct
 FROM cte;
````

<img width="355" alt="image" src="https://github.com/Gbemiclassic/Clique-Bait/blob/main/Images/Digital%20Analysis/p6.jpg">

- 15.5% of the visits that viewed the checkout page did not make a purchase

**7. What are the top 3 pages by number of views?**

````sql
SELECT
     p.page_name
    ,COUNT(visit_id) views
FROM events e
	LEFT JOIN page_hierarchy p 
		ON e.page_id = p.page_id
WHERE event_type = 1 -- to include Page View only
GROUP BY 1
ORDER BY 2 DESC
LIMIT 3;
````

<img width="425" alt="image" src="https://github.com/Gbemiclassic/Clique-Bait/blob/main/Images/Digital%20Analysis/p7.jpg">

- All Products, Checkout and Home Page are the top 3 most viewed pages.

**8. What is the number of views and cart adds for each product category?**

````sql
SELECT
	 p.product_category
	,COUNT(CASE WHEN event_type = 1 THEN visit_id ELSE NULL END) views
	,COUNT(CASE WHEN event_type = 2 THEN visit_id ELSE NULL END) cart_adds
FROM events e
	LEFT JOIN page_hierarchy p 
		ON e.page_id = p.page_id
WHERE p.product_category IS NOT NULL
GROUP BY 1
ORDER BY 2 DESC;
````

<img width="425" alt="image" src="https://github.com/Gbemiclassic/Clique-Bait/blob/main/Images/Digital%20Analysis/p8.jpg">

**9. What are the top 3 products by purchases?**

````sql
SELECT
     p.page_name AS product_name
    ,COUNT(*) purchases
FROM events e
    LEFT JOIN page_hierarchy p 
        ON e.page_id = p.page_id
WHERE visit_id IN (
					SELECT 
                        DISTINCT visit_id
					FROM events
					WHERE event_type = 3
					)
AND event_type = 2
AND p.product_id IS NOT NULL
GROUP BY 1
ORDER BY 2 DESC
LIMIT 3;
