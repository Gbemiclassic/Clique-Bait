## Solution - B. Product Funnel Analysis

Using a single SQL query - create a new output table which has the following details:

1. How many times was each product viewed?
2. How many times was each product added to cart?
3. How many times was each product added to a cart but not purchased (abandoned)?
4. How many times was each product purchased?

## Steps

These information would come from these 2 tables.
- `events` table - visit_id, page_id, event_type
- `page_hierarchy` table - page_id, product_category

**Solution**
- To get the views and cart_adds, we will simple `COUNT` the visit_id when the filter is set to 1, or 2 for views or cart_add respectively

- However, it is not as straight forward for `purchased` and `abandoned`. This is because the purchases were not broken down on product level in the events table
	- To get the purchased products, we need to isolate visit_ids that have a cart_add event and are among the subquery output of visit_ids that had a purchase event.
	- To get the abandoned products, we need to isolate visit_ids that have a cart_add event but are not among visit_ids that had a purchase event.

```sql
CREATE TABLE product_details AS
SELECT
	 page_name product_name
	,product_category
	,COUNT(CASE WHEN event_type = 1 THEN visit_id ELSE NULL END) views
	,COUNT(CASE WHEN event_type = 2 THEN visit_id ELSE NULL END) cart_adds
	,COUNT(CASE WHEN event_type = 2 AND visit_id NOT IN (SELECT visit_id FROM events WHERE event_type = 3) THEN visit_id ELSE NULL END) abandoned
	,COUNT(CASE WHEN event_type = 2 AND visit_id IN (SELECT DISTINCT visit_id FROM events WHERE event_type = 3) THEN visit_id ELSE NULL END) purchases
FROM events e
	LEFT JOIN page_hierarchy p
		ON e.page_id = p.page_id
WHERE product_id IS NOT NULL
GROUP BY 1, 2;

SELECT *
FROM product_details;
```

Additionally, create another table which further aggregates the data for the above points but this time for each product category instead of individual products.

**Solution**

```sql
CREATE TABLE prod_cat_details AS
SELECT
   product_category
  ,SUM(views)
  ,SUM(cart_adds)
  ,SUM(abandoned)
  ,SUM(purchases)
FROM product_details
GROUP BY 1
;

SELECT *
FROM prod_cat_details
```

Use your 2 new output tables - answer the following questions:

**1. Which product had the most views, cart adds and purchases?**

```sql
SELECT 
   product_name
  ,views
FROM product_details
ORDER BY 2 DESC
LIMIT 1;
```


<kbd><img width="661" alt="image" src="https://github.com/Gbemiclassic/Clique-Bait/blob/main/Images/Product%20Funnel%20Analysis/q1a.jpg"></kbd>

- Oyster has the most views.

```sql
SELECT 
   product_name
  ,cart_adds
FROM product_details
ORDER BY 2 DESC
LIMIT 1;
```

<kbd><img width="661" alt="image" src="https://github.com/Gbemiclassic/Clique-Bait/blob/main/Images/Product%20Funnel%20Analysis/q1b.jpg"></kbd>

- Lobster has the most cart adds 

```sql
SELECT 
   product_name
  ,purchases
FROM product_details
ORDER BY 2 DESC
LIMIT 1;
```

<kbd><img width="661" alt="image" src="https://github.com/Gbemiclassic/Clique-Bait/blob/main/Images/Product%20Funnel%20Analysis/q1c.jpg"></kbd>

- Lobster has the most purchases.



**2. Which product was most likely to be abandoned?**


```sql
SELECT 
   product_name
  ,abandoned
FROM product_details
ORDER BY 2 DESC
LIMIT 1;
```

<kbd><img width="599" alt="image" src="https://github.com/Gbemiclassic/Clique-Bait/blob/main/Images/Product%20Funnel%20Analysis/q2.jpg"></kbd>

- Russian Caviar is most likely to be abandoned.

**3. Which product had the highest view to purchase percentage?**


```sql
SELECT
	 product_name
	,ROUND(100 * purchases/views, 2) pct_view_to_purchase
FROM product_details
ORDER BY 2 DESC
LIMIT 1;
```

<kbd><img width="599" alt="image" src="https://github.com/Gbemiclassic/Clique-Bait/blob/main/Images/Product%20Funnel%20Analysis/q3.jpg"></kbd>

- Lobster has the highest view to purchase percentage at 48.74%.


**4. What is the average conversion rate from view to cart add?**

```sql
SELECT
	 CONCAT(ROUND(100 * SUM(cart_adds)/SUM(views), 2), '%') view_to_cart_conv_rt
FROM product_details;
```

<kbd><img width="599" alt="image" src="https://github.com/Gbemiclassic/Clique-Bait/blob/main/Images/Product%20Funnel%20Analysis/q4.jpg"></kbd>

- Average views to cart adds rate is 60.95% 

**5. What is the average conversion rate from cart add to purchase?**

```sql
SELECT
    CONCAT(ROUND(100 * SUM(purchases)/SUM(cart_adds), 2), '%') cart_to_purchases_conv_rt
FROM product_details;
```

<kbd><img width="599" alt="image" src="https://github.com/Gbemiclassic/Clique-Bait/blob/main/Images/Product%20Funnel%20Analysis/q5.jpg"></kbd>

- Average cart adds to purchases rate is 75.93%.
