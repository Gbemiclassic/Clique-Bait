# Case Study #6 - Clique Bait

## Solution - 3. Campaign Analysis

Generate a table that has 1 single row for every unique visit_id record and has the following columns:
- `user_id`
- `visit_id`
- `visit_start_time`: the earliest event_time for each visit
- `page_views`: count of page views for each visit
- `cart_adds`: count of product cart add events for each visit
- `purchase`: 1/0 flag if a purchase event exists for each visit
- `campaign_name`: map the visit to a campaign if the visit_start_time falls between the start_date and end_date
- `impression`: count of ad impressions for each visit
- `click`: count of ad clicks for each visit
- (Optional column) `cart_products`: a comma separated text value with products added to the cart sorted by the order they were added to the cart (hint: use the sequence_number)
  
**Solution**


```sql
SELECT 
	 user_id
	,e.visit_id
	,MIN(e.event_time) visit_start_time
	,SUM(CASE WHEN e.event_type = 1 THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) page_views
	,SUM(CASE WHEN e.event_type = 2 THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) cart_adds
	,SUM(CASE WHEN e.event_type = 3 THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) purchase
	,campaign_name
	,SUM(CASE WHEN e.event_type = 4 THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) impression 
	,SUM(CASE WHEN e.event_type = 5 THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) click 
	,GROUP_CONCAT(CASE 
					WHEN p.product_id IS NOT NULL 
                    AND e.event_type = 2 -- for products added to cart only
                    THEN p.page_name ELSE NULL 
                    END 
					ORDER BY e.sequence_number SEPARATOR ', '
				) cart_products
FROM events e
	INNER JOIN users u
		ON e.cookie_id = u.cookie_id
	LEFT JOIN campaign_identifier c
		ON e.event_time BETWEEN c.start_date AND c.end_date
	LEFT JOIN page_hierarchy p
		ON e.page_id = p.page_id
GROUP BY 1, 2, 7;
```
